Simple CMS in Rails
====

GreekSolution Simple CMS in rails 3.1.3.

Currently under heavy development. I tried it to keep it as simple as possible but no more simple than that. I'll add functionality with rails engines from now on which will fit perfectly with this piece.

Feel free to use it as you like. I'd love to hear your comments about. Thank you!
