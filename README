== Simple CMS in Rails

GreekSolution Simple CMS in rails 3.1.3

I tried to do it as simple as I can. Currently in heavy development. I will create engines to add more functionality in a modular way.

It is free, do whatever you want with it. I'd appreciate if you send me an email and tell me your opinion about it.
